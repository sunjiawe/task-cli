## 📖 Detailed Usage Guide

### Initialize a Project

Use the `init` command to start a new project:

```bash

```

### Start the Project Assistant

Before use, you need to configure environment variable `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` to use the LLM's API properly.

After initialization, run the program to enter the assistant terminal:
```
set DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="your-api-key"
python main.py
```

### Subcommands

Type `/` to trigger subcommand autocompletion.

```bash
# Let the AI Agent help you decompose tasks
/decompose <Describe your requirements>

# View the task list
/list

# Ask the assistant for guidance on executing a single task
/howto 

# Update task status
/update

# Generate a Gantt chart (static html file)
/gantt

# Project summary report
/report

# Ask any questions about the project in natural language
/qa
